## Immune infiltrate explorations (WIP)

We are looking to understand the current state-of-the-art and motivate new methods:

* Understand how existing methods extract representative marker genes or expression profiles from immune cell types, and their drawbacks
* Understand differences between microarry and RNAseq deconvolution
* Understand how existing methods perform deconvolution of an unknown mixture based on reference marker genes or expression signatures, and the drawbacks of these methods
* Show test cases where the existing methods fail
* Collect training/ground truth data from existing papers that we can use.

Currently cleaning up this repo.
Data used to be in this repo, and has now been purged.
Notebooks are here, writing isn't; more moving to be done.
