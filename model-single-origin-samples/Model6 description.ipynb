    "### 1. Incorporate a \"gene signature\" into model\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. in `upenn-tex`, we have up- and down-regulated gene sets that characterize the transcriptional state of exhausted T cells. We may easily incorporate these gene sets into our model by extending the matrix $\\boldsymbol{F}$, which currently only holds cell surface marker features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Incorporate TF information into model\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that transcripts regulated by the same transcription factors will be tightly co-expressed. We have two ways of incorporating this prior information into our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) One method of using $Inferelator$ is to first transform gene count data into *gene cluster* counts, where the level of each gene cluster is the arithmetic mean of the genes associated with it. This is helpful to them for reducing matrix sparsity. If we have information on a given cell type's gene regulatory network, a first experiment to assess the \n",
    "\n",
    "2) In `model6` we estimate the covariance matrix among expression profiles of different cell types. We may similarly estimate the covariance matrix among genes *within* each cell type, using the GRNs as prior knowledge.\n",

    "2. How well can we do on a less well-characterized immune cell type in a {known, unknown} mixture? \n",
