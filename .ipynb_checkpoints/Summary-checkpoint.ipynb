    "We explore the performance of 4 methods for isolating genes or expression profiles that are unique to immune cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also download 390 enriched cell type samples and do EDA to understand how much expression variance exists within and across cell types, especially when comparing genes that were or were not considered to be representative of a particular cell type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare deconvolution performance in several synthetic mixtures, with and without noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "For selected genes for a certain cell type: how much variance in expression is there within this cell type for these gene? Is it worth putting variance into our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "I took many CD8 T cell samples from across papers and normalized them all (log base 2). Then I took selected genes that Bindea had flagged as CD8 T cell-specific. I plotted a histogram of each gene's expressions, and overlayed Cibersort LM22's chosen value for this gene.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a lot of variance in the expression of genes of interest, and the point estimates that Cibersort uses do not seem to be the means of the expression distributions of all samples. Thus, better means could be found, and variance information might improve prediction.\n",

Are these methods selecting very high expression genes only? \"Selected\" could mean the ones Cibersort includes in expression profiles, or ones flagged by Bindea (probably better)\n",

Unclear why complex noise halves the error for cell types that are actually present. However, as expected, noise makes Cibersort less certain that other cell types are not there.
