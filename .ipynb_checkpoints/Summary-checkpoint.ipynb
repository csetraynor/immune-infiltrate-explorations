    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We also download 390 enriched cell type samples and do EDA to understand how much expression variance exists within and across cell types, especially when comparing genes that were or were not considered to be representative of a particular cell type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We compare deconvolution performance in several synthetic mixtures, with and without noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examination of raw data: there is a lot of variance that current methods do not capture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Among samples of one cell type: how much variation is there in genes of interest? Is variance motivated?\n",
    "\n",
    "**We observe a lot of variance in the expressions of marker genes for a particular cell type (CD8 T cell) from samples of that cell type across datasets. The reference expression value chosen by Cibersort does not seem to be the mean of the distributions. This could be due to mixed tumor vs blood origins or varying tissues of origin.** \n",

    "\n",
    "For selected genes for a certain cell type: how much variance in expression is there within this cell type for these gene? Is it worth putting variance into our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "I took many CD8 T cell samples from across papers and normalized them all (log base 2). Then I took selected genes that Bindea had flagged as CD8 T cell-specific. I plotted a histogram of each gene's expressions, and overlayed Cibersort LM22's chosen value for this gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](allvariance.png?new)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are sometimes multiple plots per gene, because each plot actually is for a particular probeset (there can be multiple probesets for a single gene). However, Cibersort's matrix has gene-level specificity, not probeset-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of variance in the expression of genes of interest, and the point estimates that Cibersort uses do not seem to be the means of the expression distributions of all samples. Thus, better means could be found, and variance information might improve prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do selected vs unselected genes look like in terms of their expressions across samples in a cell type, across all samples in all cell types (sort), across average expression in all cell types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are we going to see that unselected genes are fairly uniform and meaningless? Are they all low expression throughout? Are these methods selecting very high expression genes only? \"Selected\" could mean the ones Cibersort includes in expression profiles, or ones flagged by Bindea (probably better)\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at CD8 T cell genes (as flagged by Bindea) in samples from other cell types, we see wider expression distributions that seem more Gaussian. This may be due to having much higher sample size in the histogram.

    "**An example of how the processing methods extract reference profile signal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a pairwise Pearson correlation matrix from the raw data of Abbas 2009's first experiment. Notice the scale -- poor absolute differentiation, though there seems to be signal hidden in the data.\n",

    "## Differences between methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is being included\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biological pathways of individual cell types and connections between similar cell types are recovered -- even when combining the outputs of different methods from different datasets. Some methods seem to be noisier than others. Marker gene lists are different but include the same pathways.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The marker gene lists have mostly different genes but represent many of the same pathways. IRIS has more noise though -- e.g. lots of cell division pathways. [See section 2.1.1 of the writeup for the GO tables.](docs/reference_extraction.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise Pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering on the basis matrices recover biological similarities between certain cell types. (There is one exception: gamma delta T cells -- however these have been flagged as problematic and may be ignored.) These patterns are generally preserved across methods and across datasets. \n",

    "### What is the discriminatory ability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the condition number of the basis matrices is low, but there are some cell types that are very similar and hard to differentiate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition number of the basis matrices is low: LM22's is 11.38 (0 is best). When one of each of the two pairs of most similar cell types is removed, the condition number decreases to 9.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most similar cell types are:\n",

    "# Deconvolution in progressively more complicated synthetic mixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect there to be several pathological cases:\n",
    "* Distinguishing between two very similar immune cell subtypes\n",
    "* Distinguishing between very broad cell types -- Cibersort may fail as-is on superset classification, but will probably do well with a different training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be interesting to see what the diagnostics tell us in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "First, using Cibersort, I reproduced deconvolution of example mixtures that come with Cibersort. I got $R^2 > 0.99$. [(notebook)](Evaluating%20the%20deconvolution%20once%20we%20have%20a%20basis%20matrix.ipynb#Mixtures-that-come-with-Cibersort)\n",
