    "\n",
    "* Diagnostics ($p, R^2$) are not informative, and are misleading if anything.\n",

    "* The pathological cases are particularly painful always, regardless of how much noise, if any, is applied.\n",
    "* There is clear motivation for hierarchical classification: see the hierarchical clustering plot, and see the pathological case above. \n",
