    "There is a lot of variance in the expression of genes of interest, and the point estimates that Cibersort uses do not seem to be the means of the expression distributions of all samples. Thus, better means could be found, and variance information might improve prediction.\n",

    "Are we going to see that unselected genes are fairly uniform and meaningless? Are they all low expression throughout? Are these methods selecting very high expression genes only? \"Selected\" could mean the ones Cibersort includes in expression profiles, or ones flagged by Bindea (probably better)\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at CD8 T cell genes (as flagged by Bindea) in samples from other cell types, we see wider expression distributions that seem more Gaussian. This may be due to having much higher sample size in the histogram.
